ChoppedPress
============

Introduction
------------

**ChoppedPress** lets you split the **WordPress** XML export file into smaller files that can be used to import your posts, comments, tags and categories into a new WordPress installation.

Examples
--------

Assuming you have already gone throught the process of exporting all of your posts, comments and tags into a file named ``my-blog-YEAR-MONTH-DATE.xml``, you could then split it into several smaller XML files using the following command:

    choppedpress my-exported-wordpress.xml

This will generate **two** (this is the default) XML files named **out01.xml** and **out02.xml**. The name of the generated files and/or how many files to generate can be specified by using the appropriate flags as show by *choppedpress --help*.


    Usage:  choppedpress <INFILE> [[<OUTFILE>] [<TAG>] [<NUMBER>]]

    ChoppedPress lets you split the WordPress XML export file into smaller files
    that can be used to import your posts, comments, tags and categories into a
    new WordPress installation.

    Options:
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -i <FILE>, --infile=<FILE>
                            The XML file generated by WordPress
      -o <FILE>, --outfile=<FILE>
                            The name for the smaller XML files. [default: out]
      -t TAG, --tag=TAG     The XML tag that represents your data. [default:
                            /rss/channel/item]
      -n NUMBER, --number=NUMBER
                            How many new files should be generated. [default: 2]
