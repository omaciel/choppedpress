ChoppedPress
============

**ChoppedPress** lets you split the **WordPress** XML export file into smaller files that can be used to import your posts, comments, tags and categories into a new WordPress installation.

Assuming you have already gone throught the process of exporting all of your posts, comments and tags into a file named _my-blog-YEAR-MONTH-DATE.xml_, you could then split it into several smaller XML files using the following command:

```
choppedpress *my-blog-YEAR-MONTH-DATE.xml*
```

This will generate **two** (this is the default) XML files named **out01.xml** and **out02.xml**. The name of the generated files and/or how many files to generate can be specified by using the appropriate flags as show by *choppedpress --help*.


```
Usage:  choppedpress.py <INFILE> [[<OUTFILE>] [<TAG>] [<NUMBER>]]
